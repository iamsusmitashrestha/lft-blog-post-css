            This lake is both a man-made and natural freshwater lake, it is also
            the most visited spot in Pokhara, Annapurna. This lake is the second
            largest lake in Nepal and many water activities like canoeing,
            boating, swimming, sailing, fishing, kayaking and bird watching are
            done here. There is a Barahi Temple which stands on an island in
            this lake is dedicated to the Varaha where devotees sacrifice birds
            and animals every Saturday.

            This stunning waterfall is just about 2 km away from the Pokhara
            airport. The major source of water of this waterfall is Phewa Lake.
            The name of this fall is derived from a very unfortunate incident
            where a woman drowned and was perished in the falls and her name was
            ‘Davi’. The mystery of this fall is what attracts the visitors the
            most as the water does not flow to a river or lagoon but into a
            pitch dark hole that disappears in the caves.
